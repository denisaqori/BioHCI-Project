        """
        Computes the euclidean levenshtein distance between two tensors. This type of distance is similar to the
        levenshtein distance used on strings, but incorporates euclidean distance instead of the 0 or 1 values used
        for strings. Intuitively it measures the minimal cost of converting one tensor to another.

        Args:
            keypress1 (np.ndarray): the first tensor
            keypress2 (np.ndarray): the second tensor

        Returns:
            minimal_cost (float): the minimal cost of converting one tensor to another; distance between two tensors.
