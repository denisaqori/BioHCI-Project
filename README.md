# BioHCI

BioHCI is a comprehensive Python framework to streamline the pre-processing and facilitate the exploration of physiological time-series signal data collected during multiple user studies. It provides flexibility in experimenting with different machine learning and neural network-based approaches for model cross-validation and evaluation using PyTorch and scikit-learn.

This framework assists researchers in the data loading, pre-processing, splitting, and balancing phases, and facilitates quickly exploring deep learning models, with logging, and result visualization. BioHCI allows quick parameter adjustments, comparison of results from multiple learning algorithms, and provides a consistent way of representing data.

Enabling easy re-labeling of the same dataset dramatically accelerates the process of running different experiments with a set of sensor measurements. BioHCI also properly handles unbalanced datasets. This framework is a first step toward a more generalizable solution to physiological signal analysis and interpretation.
